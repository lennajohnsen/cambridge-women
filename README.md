# About Cambridge Women Take the Streets
Crowd Sourced City Class Project - Spring 2020

Women Take the Streets focuses on disparities in the representation of women who live or have lived in Cambridge, utilizing an Instagram filter, streetmap, and profiles of women of Cambridge. About 248,000 feet of the streets of Cambridge are named after men, while 17,450 feet were named after women -- that is only 7% of what men have.

Our project attempts to fulfill Mei-Po Kwan’s feminist visualization design principles by grounding mapping practices in our everyday experience of street signs (Mei-Po Kwan, 2002). Street signs are symbols which the viewer might never consider to be the result of historically-skewed local political processes. We seek to support women’s activism that challenges traditional power relations and forms of governance using GIS-based research and design.

Berg and Kearns’ Naming as Norming (1996) describes how naming places reinforces dominant societal ideologies by providing normality and legitimacy. By augmenting reality, our Instagram filter works toward more inclusive knowledge production. The filter centers the standpoints of women who may have been excluded in their own times (and whose lives may have since gone without significant public commemoration) on the user's phone.

Our map of Cambridge attempts to show disparities by gender with color-coded street names. Though the dataset the map is based on currently ascribes gender of historical figures in a binary fashion, we recognize the existence and need to commemorate the lives of non-binary people and transgender women. D’Ignazio and Klein suggest better representations of gender are continuous or multidimensional (Feminist Data Visualization, 2020).

Our interactive playing cards profile notable women from the Cambridge Women’s Heritage Project and research on enslaved peoples of Cambridge conducted by Grace Woodward. You can print out the cards, or even add your own heroes!
