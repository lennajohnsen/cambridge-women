            Regular City Council Meeting 01 April 2019
            CMA 2019 #68 
            (agenda packet page 4) : A communication transmitted from Louis A. DePasquale, City Manager, relative 
            to a recommendation from City Engineer Katherine Watkins, to eliminate and rename certain streets in the 
            Northpoint/Cambridge Crossing area. (24) letter from city manager (25) recommendation from DPW, city engineer 
            (Owen O’Riordan Commissioner theworks@cambridgema.gov) (27) "I have consulted with the Historical Commission, 
            the Traffic Department and the Emergency Communications Department regarding this request and have also met with 
            the adjacent property owners of the street"
    
    
            Policy Order from Awaiting Report Item AR-19-45 (awaiting from April 2019-present) 
            POR 2019 #126 WHEREAS: There are a number of streets in Cambridge, such as Vassal Lane, that may be named in honor 
            of individuals who have ties with the shameful slave trade that is a dark stain on this nation’s history; and WHEREAS: 
            In 2019, it is unacceptable for the City of Cambridge to have even the appearance of commemorating those who were involved 
            in or profited from such an abhorrent practice; now therefore be it ORDERED: That the City Manager be and hereby is requested
            to direct the appropriate City personnel to compile a full accounting of streets, schools, and public buildings that may be 
            named in honor of those who have ties to the American slave trade, and to work towards renaming all of these streets, schools, 
            and buildings as soon as possible; and be it further ORDERED: That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to report back 
            to the City Council on this matter in a timely manner; and be it further ORDERED: That this matter be referred to the Civic Unity Committee.
