    <h2> About Cambridge Women Take the Streets </h2>

    <h3> <b>Women Take the Streets</b> focuses on disparities in the representation of women who live or have lived in Cambridge, utilizing an Instagram filter, 
        streetmap, and profiles of women of Cambridge. About 248,000 feet of the streets of Cambridge are named after men, 
        while 17,450 feet were named after women -- that is only 7% of what men have. <br>
        <br />
        Our project attempts to fulfill Mei-Po Kwan’s feminist visualization design principles by grounding mapping practices in our everyday experience 
        of street signs. We incorporate qualitative and narrative components into the spatial representations of historical figures, 
        symbols which a pedestrian might otherwise never consider to be the result of a political process. <br>
        <br />
        Our <a href="process.html">Instagram filter</a> is one technique which, by augmenting reality, aligns with 
        Sandra Harding’s call for strong objectivity views. The filter works toward more inclusive knowledge production by literally centering the standpoints of 
        women who may have been excluded in their own times, and whose lives may have since gone without significant public commemoration.
        <br>
        <br />
        D’Ignazio and Klein remind us to “emphasize representational strategies premised on multiplicity rather than binaries, and acknowledge the limits of any binaristic view”, 
        and suggest better representations of gender are continuous or multidimensional (Feminist Data Visualization). Though our <a href="map.html">map of Cambridge</a> with color-coded street names attempts 
        to show disparities by gender, gender is better represented as a spectrum and not categories. In particular, though our dataset currently contains ascribed gender of historical figures
        in a binary fashiom, we recognize the existence and need to commemorate the lives of non-binary people and transgender women. For more resources for learning about and teaching gender,

        Our interactive <a href="cards.html">playing cards</a> profile notable women from the Cambridge Women’s Heritage Project and research on enslaved peoples of Cambridge conducted by Grace Woodward.
        You can print out the cards, or even add your own heroes!
