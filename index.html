    <h2> About Cambridge Women Take the Streets </h2>

    <h3> <b>Women Take the Streets</b> focuses on disparities in the representation of women who live or have lived in Cambridge, utilizing an Instagram filter, 
        map of gender disparities in representation, and profiles of women of Cambridge. <br>
        <br />
        Our project attempts to fulfill Mei-Po Kwan’s feminist visualization design principles by grounding mapping practices in our everyday experience 
        of street signs. We incorporate qualitative and narrative components into spatial representations of historical figures, 
        which a pedestrian might otherwise never consider to be a political process. <br>
        <br />
        Our <a href="process.html">Instagram filter</a> is one technique which, by augmenting reality, aligns with 
        Sandra Harding’s call for strong objectivity views. The filter works toward more inclusive knowledge production by literally centering the standpoints of 
        women who may have been excluded in their own times, and whose lives may have since gone without significant public commemoration.
        <br>
        <br />
        D’Ignazio and Klein remind us to “emphasize representational strategies premised on multiplicity rather than binaries, and acknowledge the limits of any binaristic view”, 
        and suggest better representations of gender are continuous or multidimensional (Feminist Data Visualization). Though our <a href="map.html">map of Cambridge</a> with color-coded street names attempts 
        to show disparities by gender, gender is better represented as a spectrum and not categories. In particular, though our dataset currently contains ascribed gender of historical figures
        in a binary fashiom, we recognize the existence and need to commemorate the lives of non-binary people and transgender women. For more resources for learning about and teaching gender,
